* Basic reading-learning flow
  1. Show current sentence
     - i.e. reading place in current book
  2. New lemmas in sentence are highlighted, prompting user to view definitions
  3. New word forms in sentence are highlighted, prompting user to view form
  4. User may view definitions or forms for other words
     - System tracks what words/forms user needs prompting on, and uses these to generate SRS reviews
       - Different mode from reading-learning view?
       - Prompt the user once it is a certain size?
  5. Once user understands the sentence, he or she marks it as complete
     - System adds the words and forms to its model of the user's knowledge
  6. The system shows the next sentence in the book, going back to 1.
     - Remove highlights from previous sentence?
